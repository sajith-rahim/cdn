Linear Basis Models (section 3.1)
Linear models are defined as

y(x,w)=w0,w1x1+…+wnxN

where x is the datapoint and w are the parameters of the model.

A model extension is to consider linear combinations of fixed nonlinear functions ϕ over x which are called basis functions:

y(x,w)=∑i=0Nwiϕi(xi)

where, by convention, ϕ0(x)=1.

An example of basis is the gaussian basis:

ϕ(x)=exp{−(x−μ)22σ2}
